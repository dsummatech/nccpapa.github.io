        <h2>Things Every Godly Christians Should Do Every Day</h2>
        <h4>It is what we do everyday that defines and demonstrates our faith, and for that reason we need to be intentional about how to go about it.</h4>
        <h4>There is no 12-step plan when it comes to the Christian faith, but there are certain things every Christian should do every day, and here are some</h4>

        <h1>1PRAY</h1>
        <p>Our prayer time is our personal time with God. This is the time when we block out the distractions of the world, and concentrate our attention strictly on our Creator. By connecting with God in this way, every day, we put ourselves in a better frame of mind to deal with everything we will face in our day-to-day lives.

            This is something we should look forward to as well. After all, it is the Holy Spirit who equips us and protects us to go out to the world and live our faith. If we miss this step too frequently, our faith can quickly become superficial.</p>

            <h1>2READ YOUR BIBLE</h1>
        <p>In order to consider ourselves to be “believers”, we have to be absolutely clear on what it is we actually believe in. We can do this through prayer, personal reflection, fellowship, attending church, participating in faith-based activities, and even through supplemental study. But the Bible is the very word of God – the source for everything that we all believe in.<br/>

            The only way to be clear what it is we should believe in, is to spend time studying the Bible. You should be purposeful about doing this each and every day.<br/>
            
            As believers, we have to acknowledge that there are many doctrines and beliefs that exist throughout the faith. For that reason, we need to be certain as to what the Bible says – and what it doesn’t. That’s the only way that we can know if a doctrine or belief truly comes from God...<button>Read More &RightArrow;</button></p>

    <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
    <h4>Christian missions is following Christ’s call: sharing the gospel with the lost world through God’s wisdom and strength.</h4>
    <img src="images/mi1.jpg"/>
    <p>After Christ’s death and resurrection, the Lord commanded the disciples to share the gospel, the message of His redemption: “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age” (Matthew 28:19–20).<br/><br/>
     This Great Commission applies to Christians today. Rather than weighing us down with a burden, obeying God’s call brings joy and reward in heaven. We should fulfill our mission not out of duty but love: “For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died. And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again. . . . All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God. God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Corinthians 5:14–21).<br/><br/>
     
     God could convert everyone using a blinding light and the voice of Christ as He did with the apostle Paul. Instead, He gives Christians the mission of reconciliation (Acts 1:8–9). He works through us, calling sinners to turn to Christ in repentance and faith.</p>
     <h4>Christian missions is sharing Christ</h4>
     <img src="images/mi2.jpg"/>
     <p>Our mission is proclaiming Christ as the only Savior from sin and the only way to abundant, eternal life. Whom do we tell? Jesus told Christians to reach out to “all nations” (Matthew 28:19). Jesus sends us to all people groups, to every ethnic culture without a gospel witness.<br/><br/>

         Christian missions, however, is not limited to international ministry. While believers should faithfully support those who go to the unreached on foreign soil, all Christians have the mission to share Christ on the home field with family, friends, coworkers, and the community.<br/><br/>
         
         The Christian mission of sharing Christ does not end with a sinner’s salvation. The commission was to make disciples—not immature believers. Thus, Christian missions involves not only... <a href="about.html#more"><button>read more &rightarrow;</button></a></p>
